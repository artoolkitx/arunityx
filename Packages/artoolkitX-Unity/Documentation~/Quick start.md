## Introduction

The easiest way to get started with Unity and artoolkitX is to use one of the samples scenes shipped with the arunityX package.

### Development Requirements

- mac OS or Windows

- [Xcode](http://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - Required for the mac OS version of the Unity Editor to target Apple macOS and iOS platforms with Unity. Xcode 15.4 was used at the time of this writing.

- [Unity](https://store.unity.com/) - the free, Personal Edition, is sufficient for a start. Version 6000.0.28f1 (i.e. Unity "6") was used at the time of this writing. The Unity Editor is supported on the desktop platforms of macOS and Windows.

### Installation

The artoolkitX for Unity package is published on the OpenUPM package management system. Go to [https://openupm.com/packages/org.artoolkitx.artoolkitx-unity/](https://openupm.com/packages/org.artoolkitx.artoolkitx-unity/) and follow the instructions on that page on how to add the package to your Unity project using Unity's package manager.

### Install the samples

From the artoolkitX for Unity page in the Unity Package Manager, the list of sample scenes is visible in the right-hand side of the page.

You can import each sample by clicking the "import" button next to the sample name.

### Print trackables

Each sample includes printed trackables that trigger the AR content in its `Print` folder.
