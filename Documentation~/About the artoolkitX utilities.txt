Introduction
------------

Alongside the artoolkitX runtime, there are a number of essential and helpful utilities. The utilities are distributed with the core platform-specific artoolkitX SDK package, which is available separately from artoolkitX for Unity.

The artoolkitX utilities are made available to you under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 (LGPLv3).

You can download the artoolkitX SDK for your operating system at https://github.com/artoolkitx/artoolkitx/releases/latest .

Running the utilities
---------------------

artoolkitX includes a set of utilities to perform essential functions required by artoolkitX and/or arunityX. After installation, the executables for these utilities can be found in the SDK/bin directory inside your artoolkitX directory.

  Windows:

	Each utility can be opened by double-clicking its icon in the artoolkitX\SDK\bin directory. Alternately, you can run it from the command line:

	* Open a command-line window (cmd.exe).
	* Navigate to your artoolkitX\SDK\bin directory.
	* Type (for example): artoolkitx_mk_patt.exe

  Mac OS X:

    The utilities should be launched from a Terminal window:

    * Open a Terminal window (/Applications/Utilties/Terminal).
	* Navigate to your artoolkitX/SDK/bin directory.
	* Type (for example): ./artoolkitx_mk_patt

Documentation for the utilities is held in the artoolkitX documentation wiki: https://github.com/artoolkitx/artoolkitx/wiki
